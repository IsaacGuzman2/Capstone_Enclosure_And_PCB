Hi again future student!

This here is the Kicad Project files for the Main PCB 

This PCB has the schematic and pcb files for the project as well as a folder for the gerber files to get our final version of the PCB printed by OSHPark

There should also be a .csv file here with the BOM that should help find which parts are needed in case something happens with carrying over the files. 

I HIGHLY reccomend ordering at another PCB print shop other then OSHPark because of the cost. It is a 2-layer board but it costs about $45+ with no rushed shipping (12-15 days) so it can get expensive. Please look at other options when ordering if money is an issue. 

Hopefully this file helps as always fell free to make adjustments to meet the capstone class requirements. 

Godspeed homies,
