Hi future student!

IF you are reading this congrats you get to continue a cool project that I had the pleasure of getting to start for my capstone.

This folder contains the enclosures and PCB files that I made for this project. I was mainly in charge of the more physical aspects of this project so any questions about that you can contact me about through my school email (guzmange@oregonstate.edu) 

I'd be more then happy to help with any questions. This stuff is free use so don't be afraid to delete, add, or modify in any way you see fit. I understand you will have to make your own engineering requirements so go off I guess. 

I wish you the best in this project don't forget to communicate with Gerrad he has some good ideas and even is really motivating. This project has some real impact so be proud of what you accomplish and relly try your best and you will be rewarded by making a positive impact in the world. 

Godspeed homies
