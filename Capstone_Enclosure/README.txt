Hi future student! My name is Gerardo Isaac Guzman

This folder here is the solidwork files for the main enclosure that houses the microcontroller and the battery

The enclousure is printed in parts

1x bottom piece
2x latches
1x lid
1x seal

Almost all pieces are printed in PETG except for the seal which is printed in TPU

Settings for PETG
-> Temp: 230 C
-> Bed Temp: 75 C
A quick google search or youtube video for more advanced setting parameters if you want to get technical.

TPU has similar settings with a lower bed temp. I also reccommend looking up the parameters like PETG to get a more advanced print

You should be able to export the STL files for printing through solidworks. I also wanted to give you just the solid works files so you can add your own holes and other features to meet that engineering requirment quota. My group wanted to make sure you can finish the main project while still meeting the class requirements. That way capstone should be a little easier. I hope this document helps and good luck on the project, my group had a lot of fun with it and we hope you can have as much fun as well. 

Godspeed homies,

Gerardo Isaac Guzman
